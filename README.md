# Dwarf-Briquetting-Machine
Designed an automated metal waste recycling machine to convert industrial scrap into compact briquettes, reducing waste volume by 80% and enabling efficient material reuse.
Technical Implementation:
Design Software: CATIA for 3D modeling and engineering analysis
Core Technologies: Hydraulic compression systems, automated sensors, actuator controls
Process Flow: Automated feeding → High-pressure compression → Briquette ejection

Key Results:
Reduces storage costs by 75% and transportation expenses
Enables eco-friendly waste management for steel, automotive, and manufacturing industries
Automated operation with minimal maintenance requirements

Industrial Applications: Steel plants, automotive manufacturing, recycling facilities
Skills Demonstrated: CAD design, hydraulic systems.
